# Pages

This directory contains page-level components that represent different routes/views.

## Structure
- Each page should have its own folder
- Include page component, styles, and any page-specific components
- Use PascalCase for page names

Example:
```
HomePage/
├── HomePage.jsx
├── HomePage.css
└── components/
    └── HeroSection.jsx
```
